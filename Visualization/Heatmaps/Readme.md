# Heatmaps
This folder contains information and examples on creating heatmaps in Python. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented as colors. It is a powerful visualization tool for identifying patterns and trends in large and complex datasets.

In this folder, you will find:

An explanation of what a heatmap is and when it is typically used
Information on how to create a heatmap using different libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
Examples of heatmaps created using sample data, along with the corresponding code
You will learn how to create basic heatmaps, how to customize the appearance of your heatmaps and how to add different elements to the chart to make it more readable and informative.

By the end of this folder, you should have a good understanding of how to create heatmaps in Python and how to use them to effectively communicate your data insights.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Let's get started!
You can start by looking at the 'heatmaps.md' file where you can find detailed explanations and examples of creating heatmaps in Python.

You can also use the other files in the folder for examples of creating heatmaps using different libraries and for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is by doing. I encourage you to try creating your own heatmaps using the sample data and code provided, and to experiment with different customization options to see how they affect the final visualization.
