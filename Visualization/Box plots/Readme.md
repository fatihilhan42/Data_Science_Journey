# Box Plots
This folder contains information and examples on creating box plots in Python. A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a type of plot that is used to visualize the distribution of a dataset. It is particularly useful for comparing multiple datasets or for identifying outliers in a dataset.

In this folder, you will find:

- An explanation of what a box plot is and when it is typically used
- Information on how to create a box plot using different libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- Examples of box plots created using sample data, along with the corresponding code

You will learn how to create basic box plots, how to customize the appearance of your box plots and how to add different elements to the chart to make it more readable and informative.

By the end of this folder, you should have a good understanding of how to create box plots in Python and how to use them to effectively communicate your data insights.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Let's get started!
You can start by looking at the 'box_plots.md' file where you can find detailed explanations and examples of creating box plots in Python.

You can also use the other files in the folder for examples of creating box plots using different libraries and for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is by doing. I encourage you to try creating your own box plots using the sample data and code provided, and to experiment with different customization options to see how they affect the final visualization.
