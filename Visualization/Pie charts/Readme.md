# Pie Charts
This folder contains information and examples on creating pie charts in Python. A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. Pie charts are useful for showing the proportion of different categories in a dataset.

In this folder, you will find:

An explanation of what a pie chart is and when it is typically used
Information on how to create a pie chart using different libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
Examples of pie charts created using sample data, along with the corresponding code
You will learn how to create basic pie charts, how to customize the appearance of your pie charts and how to add different elements to the chart to make it more readable and informative.

By the end of this folder, you should have a good understanding of how to create pie charts in Python and how to use them to effectively communicate your data insights.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Let's get started!
You can start by looking at the 'pie_charts.md' file where you can find detailed explanations and examples of creating pie charts in Python.

You can also use the other files in the folder for examples of creating pie charts using different libraries and for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is by doing. I encourage you to try creating your own pie charts using the sample data and code provided, and to experiment with different customization options to see how they affect the final visualization.
