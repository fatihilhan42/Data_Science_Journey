# Area Plots
This folder contains information and examples on creating area plots in Python. An area plot is a type of plot that is used to visualize time series data and to show the relative importance of different variables.

In this folder, you will find:

- An explanation of what an area plot is and when it is typically used
- Information on how to create an area plot using different libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- Examples of area plots created using sample data, along with the corresponding code

You will learn how to create stacked area plots, and how to customize the appearance of your area plots to make them more visually appealing.

By the end of this folder, you should have a good understanding of how to create area plots in Python and how to use them to effectively communicate your data insights.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Let's get started!
You can start by looking at the 'area_plots.md' file where you can find detailed explanations and examples of creating area plots in Python.

You can also use the other files in the folder for examples of creating area plots using different libraries and for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is by doing. I encourage you to try creating your own area plots using the sample data and code provided, and to experiment with different customization options to see how they affect the final visualization.
