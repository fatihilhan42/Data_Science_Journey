# Line Plots
This folder contains information and examples on creating line plots in Python. A line plot is a graphical representation of data that shows the relationship between two variables, typically one variable on the x-axis and one variable on the y-axis. Line plots are useful for visualizing continuous data and trends over time.

In this folder, you will find:

- An explanation of what a line plot is and when it is typically used
- Information on how to create a line plot using different libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- Examples of line plots created using sample data, along with the corresponding code


You will learn how to create basic line plots, how to customize the appearance of your line plots and how to add different elements to the chart to make it more readable and informative.

By the end of this folder, you should have a good understanding of how to create line plots in Python and how to use them to effectively communicate your data insights.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Let's get started!
You can start by looking at the 'line_plots.md' file where you can find detailed explanations and examples of creating line plots in Python.

You can also use the other files in the folder for examples of creating line plots using different libraries and for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is by doing. I encourage you to try creating your own line plots using the sample data and code provided, and to experiment with different customization options to see how they affect the final visualization.
