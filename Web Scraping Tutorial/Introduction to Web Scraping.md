Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves sending HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading the HTML or XML content of the website, and then parsing and extracting the data you are interested in. Web scraping can be useful for data science projects because it allows you to gather data from websites that may not have APIs or other forms of structured data available for download.

To perform web scraping with Python, you will need to use a few libraries. Some common libraries that are used for web scraping include:

- Requests: This library is used to send HTTP requests and retrieve the HTML or XML content of a website. Here is an example of how you can use the Requests library to send a GET request to a website and retrieve the response:

```Python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://example.com')
print(response.text)
```

- Beautiful Soup: This library is used to parse and extract data from HTML or XML documents. It provides a simple, elegant way to navigate and search through the content of a website. Here is an example of how you can use Beautiful Soup to parse an HTML document and extract the text of the first paragraph:

```Python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
paragraph = soup.p
print(paragraph.text)
```
