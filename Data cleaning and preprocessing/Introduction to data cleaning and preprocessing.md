# What is data cleaning and preprocessing?

Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial steps in the data science process. They involve identifying and handling issues with the data, such as missing values, errors, and inconsistencies, in order to make the data more suitable for analysis and modeling.


## Why is data cleaning and preprocessing important?
There are several reasons why data cleaning and preprocessing are important:


- ### Data quality: 
Poor quality data can lead to inaccurate or biased results, so it is important to identify and address any issues with the data before proceeding with analysis or modeling.

- Efficiency: Data cleaning and preprocessing can be time-consuming, but these steps can save time and effort in the long run by ensuring that the data is ready for analysis and modeling without the need for additional work.

- Machine learning: Many machine learning algorithms require that the data be in a specific format or have certain characteristics in order to work properly. Data cleaning and preprocessing can help to prepare the data for these algorithms.



## Types of issues that can arise during data cleaning and preprocessing
There are many different types of issues that can arise during data cleaning and preprocessing. Some common examples include:

- Missing values: Missing values occur when some data is not available or is not recorded. These can be caused by human error, technical issues, or simply because the data was not collected.

- Errors: Data errors can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as incorrect entry, transcription errors, or formatting issues.

- Inconsistencies: Data inconsistencies can occur when different sources or formats are used to record the data, resulting in different ways of representing the same information.
