# What are missing values?

Missing values occur when some data is not available or is not recorded. These can be caused by human error, technical issues, or simply because the data was not collected.


## Identifying missing values

There are several ways to identify missing values in your data:

- Pandas: Pandas is a popular Python library for working with data. You can use the .isnull() method to identify missing values in a Pandas DataFrame:

```Python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Identify missing values
missing = df.isnull()

# Print the number of missing values by column
print(missing.sum())
```


- NumPy: NumPy is a Python library for working with numerical data. You can use the isnan() function to identify missing values in a NumPy array:

```Python
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = np.load('data.npy')

# Identify missing values
missing = np.isnan(data)

# Print the number of missing values
print(np.sum(missing))
```

## Handling missing values
There are several ways to handle missing values in your data:

- Drop rows or columns: One option is to simply drop rows or columns with missing values. This can be done using the .dropna() method in Pandas:

```Python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Drop rows with missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Drop columns with missing values
df = df.dropna(axis=1)
```


- Impute missing values: Another option is to impute missing values, which means replacing them with statistical measures such as the mean or median. This can be done using the SimpleImputer class in scikit-learn:

```Python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Load the data
X = np.load('data.npy')

# Create an imputer
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

# Fit the imputer to the data
imputer.fit(X)

# Impute the missing values
X = imputer.transform(X)

```
The strategy parameter specifies the method used to impute the missing values. Options include 'mean', 'median', 'most_frequent', and 'constant'.

## Advantages and disadvantages of imputing missing values
There are pros and cons to imputing missing values:

- Advantages: Imputing missing values allows you to keep all of the data and can reduce bias in the analysis.

- Disadvantages: Imputing missing values may introduce bias or distort the distribution of the data. It is also important to consider the reason for the missing values and whether imputation is appropriate in a given situation.
