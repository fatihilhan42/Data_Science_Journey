# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

This folder contains resources and tutorials on machine learning in Python, covering a wide range of topics, such as:

- Introduction to machine learning concepts and types of algorithms
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Popular machine learning libraries and frameworks
- Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation
- Applications of machine learning in various domains


The tutorials and examples provided in this folder will use various libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras, to help you build and train machine learning models and apply them to real-world problems.

Please browse through the files in this folder to find the topics you're interested in, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further help.
