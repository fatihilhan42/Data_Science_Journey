## Multi-Armed Bandits
Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) is a classic problem in the field of reinforcement learning and decision-making under uncertainty. The term "multi-armed bandits" is inspired by a casino setting, where a gambler faces a row of slot machines (one-armed bandits) with different payout probabilities. The gambler must decide which slot machine to play (pull the arm) at each time step to maximize their total reward over time.

In the MAB problem, the agent is presented with a set of "arms," each associated with a probability distribution that generates rewards. The goal of the agent is to find the best arm (action) that yields the highest expected reward and accumulate as much reward as possible while exploring the uncertain environment.

### Problem Formulation
In a typical MAB problem, the agent faces the following challenges:

- **Exploration**: The agent needs to explore different arms to gather information about their reward distributions and identify the best arm(s).

- **Exploitation**: The agent should exploit the arms that have shown higher rewards in the past to maximize the accumulated reward.

The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is a central theme in MAB problems, similar to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning.

### Types of Multi-Armed Bandits
There are several types of MAB problems based on the characteristics of the arms and rewards:

### Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits:
In this type, each arm has an unknown probability distribution for generating rewards. The agent's task is to learn the mean (expected value) of each arm's distribution and make decisions based on the current estimates.

### Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits:
In adversarial MAB, the rewards of the arms are determined by an adversary rather than being generated from fixed probability distributions. The agent faces a challenging task of adapting to the changing rewards without any information about the adversary's strategy.

### Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits:
Contextual MAB incorporates additional contextual information or features associated with each arm. The agent needs to learn a mapping between the context and the optimal action to make personalized decisions for different contexts.

### Semi-Bandits:
Semi-bandits are a generalization of the MAB problem where the agent receives partial information about the rewards. This setting is often encountered when the agent can only observe noisy or incomplete feedback from the environment.

### Algorithms for Multi-Armed Bandits
Several algorithms are used to solve MAB problems and balance exploration and exploitation. Some popular algorithms include:

- **Epsilon-Greedy**: The agent selects the arm with the highest estimated reward most of the time (exploitation) but occasionally explores other arms with a small probability (exploration).

- **UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)**: This algorithm uses confidence intervals to select arms with high upper bounds on their expected rewards, encouraging exploration of uncertain arms.

- **Thompson Sampling**: Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian algorithm that samples arms from their posterior distribution, balancing exploration and exploitation based on uncertainty.

### Applications
The Multi-Armed Bandits problem arises in various real-world scenarios, such as:

- **Online Advertising**: In online advertising, advertisers must decide which ad to display to users to maximize clicks and conversions.

- **Clinical Trials**: In medical research, multi-armed bandits are used to efficiently allocate resources among different treatments in clinical trials.

- **Recommender Systems**: Recommender systems use MAB algorithms to determine which items to recommend to users for personalized recommendations.

- **A/B Testing**: A/B testing is a form of multi-armed bandit problem where different versions of a webpage or application are tested to find the best-performing one.

The Multi-Armed Bandits problem serves as a fundamental building block for more complex reinforcement learning and decision-making tasks and provides valuable insights into the exploration-exploitation trade-off in uncertain environments. Various algorithms and techniques have been developed to tackle MAB problems and achieve effective decision-making in a wide range of applications.
