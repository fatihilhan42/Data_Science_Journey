## Model-Free Prediction
Model-Free Prediction is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, where the agent aims to learn the value function or the state-value function without knowing the explicit dynamics of the environment. In other words, the agent learns to predict the expected cumulative reward from each state without having a complete model of how the environment transitions between states.

### Value Function
The value function is a key concept in model-free prediction. It estimates the expected cumulative reward an agent can achieve from a particular state following a given policy. There are two types of value functions:

1. **State-Value Function (V(s))**: The state-value function V(s) estimates the expected cumulative reward starting from a given state s and following a specific policy.

2. **Action-Value Function (Q(s, a))**: The action-value function Q(s, a) estimates the expected cumulative reward starting from a given state s, taking action a, and following a specific policy.

### Temporal Difference Learning
Temporal Difference (TD) learning is one of the core methods used in model-free prediction. It combines ideas from dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods. TD learning updates the value function iteratively based on the observed rewards and transitions experienced by the agent during its interaction with the environment.

1. **TD(0)**: TD(0) is one of the simplest TD learning methods, where the value function is updated based on a one-step look-ahead, considering the immediate reward and the estimated value of the next state.

2. **TD(λ)**: TD(λ) is a more general form of TD learning that combines multiple time steps for updates. The parameter λ (lambda) determines the weight given to different time steps, ranging from a single-step TD(0) update (λ = 0) to a Monte Carlo-like update (λ = 1).

### Monte Carlo Methods
Monte Carlo methods are another approach for model-free prediction. Instead of updating the value function based on bootstrapping (like in TD learning), Monte Carlo methods estimate the value function by averaging the actual observed returns from sampled trajectories.

1. **First-Visit Monte Carlo**: In the first-visit Monte Carlo method, the value function is updated only when the agent visits a state for the first time in an episode.

2. **Every-Visit Monte Carlo**: In the every-visit Monte Carlo method, the value function is updated every time the agent visits a state, regardless of whether it is the first visit or not.

### On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Learning
In model-free prediction, there are two main types of learning:

1. On-Policy Learning: In on-policy learning, the agent learns the value function while following the same policy that it is trying to evaluate.

2. Off-Policy Learning: In off-policy learning, the agent learns the value function while following a different policy (often an exploratory policy) from the one it is evaluating.

### Applications
Model-Free Prediction is used in various real-world applications, such as:

- **Game Playing**: In games like chess or Go, agents use model-free prediction to learn the value function and make informed decisions.

- **Robotics**: Reinforcement learning agents in robotics use model-free prediction to estimate the expected rewards for different states and actions.

- **Finance**: Model-free prediction is applied in financial markets to predict future stock prices and make investment decisions.
