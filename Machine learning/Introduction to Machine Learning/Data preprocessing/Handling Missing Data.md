## Handling Missing Data
Missing data is a common challenge in real-world datasets, and it can have a significant impact on the quality and reliability of machine learning models. Dealing with missing data is an essential step in the data preprocessing pipeline, as it can affect the accuracy, performance, and generalizability of the models.

Missing data can occur due to various reasons, such as data entry errors, sensor malfunctions, survey non-responses, or other issues. It is crucial to handle missing data appropriately to avoid biased or incomplete analyses.

There are several strategies to handle missing data, and the choice of method depends on the nature and extent of missingness in the dataset. Here are some common techniques:

1. Deletion: In this approach, rows or columns containing missing values are entirely removed from the dataset. This method is suitable when the missing values are few and randomly distributed. However, it may result in a loss of information and can introduce bias if the missingness is related to the target variable or other important features.

2. Imputation: Imputation involves filling in the missing values with estimated or imputed values. This approach allows for retaining the information from the incomplete observations. Popular imputation techniques include mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, and regression imputation. The choice of imputation method depends on the data type, distribution, and relationships among variables.

3. Predictive Models: In some cases, missing values can be predicted based on the available data using machine learning models. For example, regression models or decision trees can be used to estimate missing values based on other variables. This approach can be useful when there is a significant relationship between the missing values and the observed data.

4. Multiple Imputation: Multiple imputation is a more sophisticated approach that involves creating multiple plausible imputations for missing values based on statistical models. These imputed datasets are then analyzed separately, and the results are combined to obtain a more accurate estimate of the missing values. Multiple imputation takes into account the uncertainty associated with the imputed values.

It is important to note that the choice of missing data handling technique should be based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis. Additionally, it is essential to evaluate the impact of the chosen method on the results and the assumptions made during the imputation process.

Handling missing data requires careful consideration and should be done in a principled and transparent manner. It is crucial to document and report the missing data handling process to ensure reproducibility and transparency in research.

In the subsequent files of this folder, we will dive deeper into each of these techniques and explore best practices for handling missing data in different scenarios.
