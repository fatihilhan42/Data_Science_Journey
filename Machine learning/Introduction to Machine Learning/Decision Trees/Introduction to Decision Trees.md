# Introduction to Decision Trees

Decision trees are a popular supervised learning algorithm that are used for both classification and regression problems. They are called decision trees because they represent a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. The algorithm starts with a single node, called the root, and recursively splits the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on the feature that provides the most information gain. Each split results in a new node in the tree, and the process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of samples in a leaf node.

In classification problems, each leaf node of the decision tree represents a class label, and the goal is to predict the class of a new data point by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node. In regression problems, each leaf node represents a predicted value, and the goal is to predict the value of a new data point based on its features.

The beauty of decision trees is their interpretability: the structure of the tree represents the relationships between the features and the target variable, and the tree can be visualized and easily explained to stakeholders. However, they are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes very deep and complex. To prevent overfitting, several techniques have been developed, such as pruning the tree, early stopping, and ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

In this file, we will learn the basics of decision trees and see how they can be implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. We will also discuss the various parameters that can be tuned to improve the performance of decision trees and see how to evaluate the performance of a decision tree model.
