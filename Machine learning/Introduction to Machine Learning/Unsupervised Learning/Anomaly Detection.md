## Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is a machine learning technique used to identify rare and abnormal observations or patterns in data. Anomalies are data points that significantly deviate from the normal behavior of the majority of the data. Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various domains, including fraud detection, intrusion detection, fault detection in industrial systems, and medical diagnosis.

In this section, we will explore some of the common methods and techniques used for anomaly detection.

1. Statistical Methods
Statistical methods are among the simplest and most widely used approaches for anomaly detection. These methods typically assume that normal data follows a specific statistical distribution, such as Gaussian (normal) distribution. They compute statistical metrics, such as mean and standard deviation, to determine the boundaries of normal behavior and identify data points that fall outside these boundaries as anomalies.

- Z-Score: Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. Data points with a Z-score above a certain threshold are considered anomalies.

- Modified Z-Score: Similar to Z-score, but it uses the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of the mean and standard deviation.

- Percentiles: This method defines a range of percentiles (e.g., 95th percentile) as the boundary for normal behavior. Data points falling outside this range are considered anomalies.

2. Distance-Based Methods
Distance-based methods rely on calculating the distance between data points to detect anomalies. They assume that normal data points are close to each other, while anomalies are far from the majority of data points.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN measures the distance of a data point to its k-nearest neighbors. Data points with unusually large distances are classified as anomalies.

- Local Outlier Factor (LOF): LOF calculates the density of a data point compared to its neighbors. Anomalies have a significantly lower density compared to normal data points.

3. Machine Learning-Based Methods
Machine learning-based methods use supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms to identify anomalies. Unsupervised techniques are more common in anomaly detection, as labeled anomalies may be scarce or hard to obtain.

- Isolation Forest: Isolation Forest is an ensemble-based method that isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data and building isolation trees. Anomalies are expected to have shorter path lengths in the trees.

- One-Class SVM: One-Class SVM is a support vector machine variant that learns the boundary of normal data and classifies data points outside this boundary as anomalies.

4. Deep Learning-Based Methods
Deep learning-based methods, particularly autoencoders, have also shown promise in anomaly detection. Autoencoders are trained to reconstruct input data, and anomalies are likely to have higher reconstruction errors.

Applications of Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection has various applications, including:

- Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent transactions or activities in financial systems.
- Intrusion Detection: Detecting unauthorized access or attacks in computer networks.
- Fault Detection: Identifying faults or anomalies in industrial processes and machinery.
- Health Monitoring: Detecting anomalies in patient health data for early diagnosis.

In the following sections, we will explore these anomaly detection methods in more detail, provide examples of their implementation in Python using popular libraries, and discuss how to evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.
