## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are commonly used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. They are inspired by the organization of the visual cortex in animals, which contains neurons that are sensitive to specific features in the visual field.

### Convolutional layers
The key component of a CNN is the convolutional layer, which applies a set of learnable filters to the input image in order to extract features. Each filter performs a convolution operation on the input image, producing a feature map that highlights the regions of the image that are most similar to the filter.

### Pooling layers
Pooling layers are typically used after convolutional layers in order to reduce the spatial size of the feature maps and to make the network more computationally efficient. The most common type of pooling operation is max pooling, which replaces each local patch of the feature map with its maximum value.

### Fully connected layers
After several layers of convolution and pooling, the feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector and passed through one or more fully connected layers, which perform a non-linear transformation of the feature vector in order to classify the image into one of several classes.

### Other components
In addition to convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, CNNs can also include other components such as dropout layers, which randomly drop out a fraction of the nodes during training in order to prevent overfitting, and normalization layers, which normalize the output of each neuron to ensure that it is in a reasonable range.

### Training
Training a CNN involves selecting an appropriate architecture (i.e., the number and types of layers), initializing the weights of the network, and then using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to adjust the weights so as to minimize a loss function. The loss function is typically a measure of the difference between the predicted class probabilities and the true class labels, and the optimization algorithm adjusts the weights in order to minimize this difference.

### Applications
CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image recognition and computer vision tasks, including object recognition, object detection, image segmentation, and image captioning. They have also been applied to other domains such as natural language processing and speech recognition.
