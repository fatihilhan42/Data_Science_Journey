## Autoencoders
Autoencoders are neural networks that are trained to reproduce their input data as closely as possible. They are often used for unsupervised learning, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. Autoencoders consist of an encoder and a decoder network. The encoder network takes the input data and produces a compressed representation, typically a lower-dimensional vector, which is then fed into the decoder network to produce the reconstructed output.

### Types of Autoencoders
There are several types of autoencoders, including:

### Vanilla Autoencoder
The vanilla autoencoder is the simplest type of autoencoder, consisting of a single hidden layer that connects the input layer to the output layer. The hidden layer has fewer neurons than the input layer, which forces the network to learn a compressed representation of the input data. The loss function used to train the vanilla autoencoder is typically the mean squared error between the input and the output.

### Denoising Autoencoder
The denoising autoencoder is similar to the vanilla autoencoder, but it is trained to reconstruct data that has been corrupted by noise. The idea behind this is that the network learns to extract the most important features of the data and can use this knowledge to reconstruct the original signal even if it is corrupted.

### Convolutional Autoencoder
Convolutional autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that use convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers. They are commonly used for image data, where the convolutional layers can extract spatial features of the image. The encoder network consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, while the decoder network consists of deconvolutional layers followed by upsampling layers.

### Recurrent Autoencoder
Recurrent autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that can handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language data. The encoder network consists of a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as a LSTM or GRU, that processes the input sequence and produces a compressed representation. The decoder network is another RNN that takes the compressed representation and produces the reconstructed output sequence.

### Variational Autoencoder
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of autoencoder that is designed to generate new data points that are similar to the training data. They are trained to learn a probability distribution over the input data, which can then be used to generate new samples by sampling from the distribution. VAEs use a loss function that encourages the learned distribution to match a standard normal distribution.

### Applications of Autoencoders
Autoencoders have a wide range of applications, including:

- Data compression
- Denoising and inpainting
- Image and video super-resolution
- Anomaly detection
- Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
- Generative models and data synthesis

Example Code
Here's an example of how to implement a vanilla autoencoder using Keras:

```python 
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras.models import Model

# define input shape
input_shape = (784,)

# define encoder architecture
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)
hidden_layer = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
compressed_layer = Dense(64, activation='relu')(hidden_layer)

# define decoder architecture
hidden_layer_2 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(compressed_layer)
output_layer = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(hidden_layer_2)

# create autoencoder model
autoencoder = Model(input_layer, output_layer)

# compile model
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

In this example, we define a simple autoencoder architecture with one hidden layer in the encoder and decoder. We use the mean squared error loss function to train the model to
