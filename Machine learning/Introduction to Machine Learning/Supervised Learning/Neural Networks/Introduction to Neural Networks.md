## Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are widely used for a variety of tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process input data and produce output. Each neuron receives input from other neurons or from external sources, and applies an activation function to the input to determine its output. The weights of the connections between neurons are adjusted during training to optimize the performance of the network on a particular task.

Neural networks are particularly well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of complex data, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. They are also capable of learning complex non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, making them a powerful tool for many real-world applications.

In this folder, we will explore the basics of neural networks, including the different types of neural networks, the architecture of a typical neural network, the backpropagation algorithm used for training, and the practical considerations involved in building and training neural networks. We will also provide code examples using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
