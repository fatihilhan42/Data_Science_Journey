Ensemble methods are a class of machine learning techniques that involve combining multiple models to improve the overall performance of a predictive model. In other words, the idea behind ensemble methods is to aggregate the predictions of several models, in order to reduce bias, variance, or both.

There are two main types of ensemble methods: bagging and boosting. Bagging methods involve training multiple independent models in parallel on random subsets of the training data, and aggregating their predictions to form a final output. Boosting methods, on the other hand, train a sequence of models where each subsequent model tries to correct the mistakes of the previous ones.

Ensemble methods have gained popularity over the years, especially in the context of machine learning competitions where they have been shown to improve the performance of models significantly. They are also commonly used in industry applications where predictive accuracy is critical.

### Advantages of Ensemble Methods
The primary advantage of ensemble methods is that they tend to improve the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. Ensemble methods can be particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete datasets, or when the underlying relationship between the input features and the target variable is complex or nonlinear.

Additionally, ensemble methods can help to reduce overfitting, by combining models that have been trained on different subsets of the training data. This can help to generalize the model and improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### Disadvantages of Ensemble Methods
One potential disadvantage of ensemble methods is that they can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models. Additionally, ensemble methods can be prone to overfitting if the individual models in the ensemble are too complex or if they are trained on the same data.

Another potential disadvantage is that ensemble methods can be difficult to interpret and understand. Because the final prediction is based on a combination of several models, it can be challenging to determine which features are most important, or to understand the underlying logic behind the prediction.

Despite these potential drawbacks, ensemble methods remain a powerful and widely used technique in machine learning, and have been shown to improve the performance of models across a wide range of applications.
