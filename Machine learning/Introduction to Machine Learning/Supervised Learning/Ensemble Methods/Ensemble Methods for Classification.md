## Ensemble Methods for Classification
Ensemble methods can be used for classification problems as well. In classification problems, the goal is to predict the class label of an input sample. The class label can be binary or multi-class. Ensemble methods can be used to improve the classification performance of a model by combining multiple classifiers.

### Types of Ensemble Methods for Classification
The types of ensemble methods for classification are similar to those for regression. They include:

1. Bagging: This is a method in which multiple independent classifiers are trained on different random subsets of the training data. The final classification decision is made by taking a majority vote of the predictions of all the classifiers. Bagging can improve the stability and accuracy of the model.

2. Boosting: Boosting is a method in which multiple weak classifiers are combined to form a strong classifier. Each weak classifier is trained on a weighted version of the training data, where the weights of the samples are updated based on the classification performance of the previous weak classifiers. Boosting can improve the accuracy of the model.

3. Stacking: Stacking is a method in which multiple heterogeneous classifiers are combined using a meta-classifier. The predictions of the heterogeneous classifiers are used as input to the meta-classifier, which then makes the final classification decision. Stacking can improve the accuracy of the model by combining the strengths of different classifiers.

### Applications of Ensemble Methods for Classification
Ensemble methods for classification have been used in a variety of applications, including:

1. Image Classification: Ensemble methods have been used to improve the accuracy of image classification models. In image classification, the goal is to classify images into different categories based on their visual features.

2. Natural Language Processing: Ensemble methods have been used to improve the accuracy of natural language processing models. In natural language processing, the goal is to process and analyze human language, such as text and speech.

3. Fraud Detection: Ensemble methods have been used to improve the accuracy of fraud detection models. In fraud detection, the goal is to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud and identity theft.

### Conclusion
Ensemble methods can be used to improve the accuracy and stability of classification models. The most commonly used ensemble methods for classification are bagging, boosting, and stacking. These methods have been applied to a variety of applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and fraud detection.
