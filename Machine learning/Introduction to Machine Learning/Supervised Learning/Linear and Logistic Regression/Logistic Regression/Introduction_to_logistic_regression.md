# Introduction to Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in classification problems. The goal of logistic regression is to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables.

## How does it work?
The logistic regression model is a linear model for binary classification. It is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. The model creates a relationship between the features and the log odds of the response, which is modeled using a logistic function.

## Assumptions of Logistic Regression
Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.
For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.
Only the meaningful variables should be included.
The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.
The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.

## Advantages of Logistic Regression
The logistic regression model is easy to implement and can be easily regularized to prevent overfitting.
The model can handle a mix of continuous and categorical features.
It is easy to interpret the model results.
Logistic regression can be used for binary and multinomial classification problems.

## Disadvantages of Logistic Regression
Logistic regression makes strong assumptions about the independence of the features and the linearity of the relationship between the features and the log odds of the response.
The model may not perform well with highly correlated features or when the data is not linearly separable.
