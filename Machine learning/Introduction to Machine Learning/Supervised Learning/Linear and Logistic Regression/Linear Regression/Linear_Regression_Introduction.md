# Linear Regression Introduction

Linear regression is a method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the response variable or target) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictors or features). It is a type of supervised learning, which means that the goal is to learn a model from labeled training data that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In linear regression, the goal is to find the line of best fit that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the true values. The line of best fit is represented by the equation:

y = b0 + b1 * x

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b0 is the y-intercept, and b1 is the slope of the line. The coefficients b0 and b1 are determined using the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the true values.

Linear regression can be used for both simple and multiple regression, depending on the number of independent variables. Simple linear regression is used when there is only one independent variable, while multiple linear regression is used when there are two or more independent variables.

The assumptions of linear regression are:

- Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
- Independence: The observations are independent of each other.
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable.
- Normality: The errors are normally distributed.

Understanding these assumptions is important for interpreting the results and for determining if the model is a good fit for the data.

In summary, linear regression is a simple and powerful tool for modeling linear relationships between variables. It is widely used in a variety of fields, such as economics, finance, and social sciences, to make predictions and understand the relationships between variables.


- Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to model a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- The goal of linear regression is to find the line of best fit that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.
- The line of best fit is represented by the equation y = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$x, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, and $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the model parameters.
- The values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are found by minimizing the cost function, which is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.
- Linear regression can be used for both simple linear regression (one independent variable) and multiple linear regression (multiple independent variables).
- Linear regression can be implemented using various libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.
