## **Introduction to SVMs:** A brief overview of what Support Vector Machines are, how they work, and when they are most useful.

## **Code Examples:** Several code examples demonstrating how to use SVMs for classification and regression tasks in Python. These examples could include:

- A simple example of using an SVM for binary classification with synthetic data.
- A more complex example of using SVMs for multiclass classification with a real-world dataset.
- An example of using an SVM for regression with a real-world dataset.
- An example of how to use the GridSearchCV class to tune hyperparameters for an SVM.

## **Visualizations:** Some visual aids to help understand SVMs. These could include:

- A visualization of how SVMs work for binary classification tasks.
- A visualization of the kernel trick and how it can be used to transform data into a higher-dimensional space.
- A visualization of the decision boundaries created by an SVM on a two-dimensional dataset.

## **Resources:** Links to additional resources, such as tutorials, blog posts, academic papers, and books, that provide more in-depth explanations of SVMs and their applications.

## **Notes:** Any notes you take on the topic while studying, such as mathematical derivations, important concepts, or gotchas to watch out for.
