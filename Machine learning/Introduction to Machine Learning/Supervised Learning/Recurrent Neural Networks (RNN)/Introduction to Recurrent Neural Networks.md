## Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network commonly used in sequence modeling tasks, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series analysis. They are capable of processing sequential data by maintaining an internal memory that can selectively remember or forget previous inputs.

The architecture of an RNN is similar to that of a feedforward neural network, with the addition of a feedback loop. This feedback loop allows the network to maintain a hidden state, which can be thought of as a compressed representation of the previous inputs.

RNNs have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to model long-term dependencies in sequential data. However, they are also known to suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become exponentially small as they propagate back through time. This problem can make it difficult to train RNNs on long sequences.

To address this issue, several variants of RNNs have been developed, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. These architectures are designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by introducing gating mechanisms that control the flow of information through the network.

In this folder, we will cover the basics of RNNs, their architecture, training techniques, and applications. We will also explore some of the more advanced variants of RNNs, such as LSTMs and GRUs, and how they are used in practice.
