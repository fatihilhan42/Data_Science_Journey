# Introduction to Random Forest

Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It is based on decision tree algorithms that combine multiple decision trees to make a single prediction. The key idea behind Random Forest is to combine the predictions of many individual decision trees, which together create a more accurate and stable prediction than a single decision tree.

The name "Random Forest" refers to the fact that the individual trees are built using a random sample of the input data and a random subset of the features, providing a diverse set of decision trees that can help overcome the overfitting problems often encountered when using a single decision tree.

Random Forest has gained popularity in various applications, including finance, medicine, and the natural sciences, because it is easy to use, flexible, and can be applied to large datasets.

This folder contains, we will cover the key concepts of Random Forest, including how it works, how to build a model, and how to evaluate and optimize it. We will also discuss its strengths and weaknesses, and provide some practical tips on how to use Random Forest effectively in your projects.
