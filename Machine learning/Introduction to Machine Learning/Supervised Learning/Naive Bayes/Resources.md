**[Naive-bayes Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html):** Naive bayes documentation prepared by Scikit learn

**[Naive bayes documentation prepared by Scikit learn](https://www.codespeedy.com/naive-bayes-algorithm-in-python/)** - Naive Bayes theorem works on the basis of probability. Some students are very afraid of probability. So here is a blog post that makes this lesson very easy to understand.

**[Naive Bayes Classification Using Scikit-learn In Python](https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-analytics/naive-bayes-classification/)** - Data Classification is one of the most common problems to solve in data analytics. While the process becomes simpler using platforms like R & Python, it is essential to understand which technique to use. In this blog post, we will speak about one of the most powerful & easy-to-train classifiers, ‘Naive Bayes Classification. This is a classification technique that determines the probability of an outcome, given a set of conditions using the Bayes theorem.

**[What are Naive Bayes classifiers?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/naive-bayes)** - The Naïve Bayes classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which is used for classification tasks, like text classification. It is also part of a family of generative learning algorithms, meaning that it seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category. Unlike discriminative classifiers, like logistic regression, it does not learn which features are most important to differentiate between classes. 

**[Naive Bayes Classifiers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/naive-bayes-classifiers/)** - This article discusses the theory behind the Naive Bayes classifiers and their implementation.

**[What is the Naïve Bayes Classifier Algorithm and how does it work?](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/what-is-the-na%C3%AFvebayes-classifier-algorithm-and-how-does-it-work-331e8da05dce)** - Naïve Bayes is a predictive modeling algorithm which is very simple yet, very powerful. Also, Naïve Bayes is a machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem and can be implemented in various classification tasks.

**[Naive Bayes Tutorial for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/naive-bayes-tutorial-for-machine-learning/)** - Naive Bayes is a very simple classification algorithm that makes some strong assumptions about the independence of each input variable.
