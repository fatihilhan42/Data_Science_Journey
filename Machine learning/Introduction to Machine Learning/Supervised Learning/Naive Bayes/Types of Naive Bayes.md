Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. There are three main types of Naive Bayes classifiers:

1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** This classifier assumes that the features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is the most commonly used variant of Naive Bayes, and is suitable for continuous data.

2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** This classifier is used when the features are discrete counts, such as word frequencies in a text document. It is commonly used for text classification problems, such as sentiment analysis.

3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** This classifier is similar to the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, but is used when the features are binary (i.e., either present or absent). It is commonly used for problems such as spam filtering, where the presence or absence of certain keywords can be used to classify an email as spam or not spam.
