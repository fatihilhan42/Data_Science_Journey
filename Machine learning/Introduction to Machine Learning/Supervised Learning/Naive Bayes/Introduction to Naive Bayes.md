# Introduction to Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a family of simple probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes' theorem, which is used to solve classification and regression problems. It is a popular choice for text classification tasks, such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis, but it can also be used for other types of data.

Naive Bayes algorithms are based on the assumption that the features are conditionally independent given the class label. This is called the "naive" assumption because it simplifies the calculation of the probability distribution over the features. Despite this simplification, Naive Bayes can often achieve competitive results with more complex algorithms.

In this folder, we will explore the concept of Naive Bayes and its various implementations, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Naive Bayes and provide examples of its use in real-world applications.
