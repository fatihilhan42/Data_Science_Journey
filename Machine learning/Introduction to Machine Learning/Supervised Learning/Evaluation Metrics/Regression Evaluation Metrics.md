## Regression Evaluation Metrics

### Overview
Regression evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of machine learning models on regression tasks. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is predicting continuous or numerical values. By evaluating various aspects of regression performance, we can determine the accuracy and precision of the model's predictions.

### Common Regression Evaluation Metrics

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It gives an indication of the model's average prediction error. MAE is calculated as:

```python
MAE = (1 / n) * Σ|y_pred - y_actual|
```

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. It gives more weight to larger errors and is commonly used in regression tasks. MSE is calculated as:

```python
MSE = (1 / n) * Σ(y_pred - y_actual)^2
```

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the Mean Squared Error. It provides an easily interpretable metric in the same unit as the target variable. RMSE is calculated as:

```python
RMSE = √MSE
```

4. **R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
The R-squared (or Coefficient of Determination) measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. It ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit. R-squared is calculated as:

```python
R-squared = 1 - (MSE_model / MSE_baseline)
```

5. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) measures the average percentage difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is commonly used when the scale of the target variable is significant. MAPE is calculated as:

```python
MAPE = (1 / n) * Σ(|(y_pred - y_actual) / y_actual|) * 100
```

6. **Explained Variance Score**
The Explained Variance Score measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit. Explained Variance Score is calculated as:

```python
Explained Variance Score = 1 - (Var(y_pred - y_actual) / Var(y_actual))
```

### Conclusion
Regression evaluation metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of machine learning models on regression tasks. By considering metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, MAPE, and Explained Variance Score, we can assess the model's ability to predict continuous or numerical values accurately. Each evaluation metric has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of metrics depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the regression problem at hand.

In the subsequent sections, we will delve into each of these regression evaluation metrics, exploring their definitions, use cases, and interpretations, along with examples of their implementation in Python.

Remember, the choice of evaluation metrics should align with the problem statement, the nature of the data, and the desired outcomes. A comprehensive understanding of regression evaluation metrics is essential for accurate assessment and interpretation of model performance.

Let's dive deeper into each evaluation metric and explore their applications in regression tasks.
