Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output (label) is provided for each input. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to the output labels, so that the algorithm can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.

This folder contains resources and tutorials on supervised learning in Python, covering a wide range of topics such as:

- Linear and logistic regression
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Evaluation Metrics, overfitting and underfitting
- Real-world examples

All tutorials and examples will be provided with python implementation and explanations.
