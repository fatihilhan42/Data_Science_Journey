# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output (label) is provided for each input. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to the output labels, so that the algorithm can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.
