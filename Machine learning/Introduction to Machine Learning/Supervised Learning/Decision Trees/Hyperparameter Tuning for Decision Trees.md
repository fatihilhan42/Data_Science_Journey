**Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. In the case of decision trees, the hyperparameters to be tuned include:**

**Maximum Depth:** The maximum number of levels that a decision tree can have.

**Minimum Samples Split:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.

**Minimum Samples Leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be present in a leaf node.

**Maximum Features:** The number of features to be considered when looking for the best split.

**Maximum Leaf Nodes:** The maximum number of leaf nodes that a decision tree can have.

There are several methods to perform hyperparameter tuning in decision trees, including Grid Search and Randomized Search.

For example, to perform Grid Search in scikit-learn, you can use the GridSearchCV class as follows:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Define the hyperparameters to be searched
param_grid = {'max_depth': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
              'min_samples_split': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
              'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

# Create a decision tree classifier
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Create a grid search object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(dt, param_grid, cv=5)

# Fit the grid search to the training data
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best hyperparameters
print('Best hyperparameters: ', grid_search.best_params_)
```

**Best hyperparameters:  {'max_depth': 4, 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 2}**


In this example, the GridSearchCV object is created with the decision tree classifier and the hyperparameters to be searched. The fit method is then called on the grid search object, which performs a 5-fold cross-validation on the training data and selects the best hyperparameters based on the mean cross-validated score.
