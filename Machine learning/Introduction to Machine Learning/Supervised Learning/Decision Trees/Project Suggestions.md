# Decision Trees Project Suggestions

### Here are three project suggestions that you can do to better understand linear and logistic regression:

1. **House Price Prediction:** Use a dataset of real estate prices to build a linear regression model that predicts the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features. You could try to improve your model by adding more features or using a more advanced regression technique like ridge or lasso regression.

2- **Customer Churn Analysis:** Use a dataset of customer behavior to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not. You could start by using basic demographic information about the customer, and then try to improve your model by adding other features like customer behavior data.

3- **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Use a dataset of credit card transactions to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. You could start by using basic information about the transaction, such as the amount and time of the transaction, and then try to improve your model by adding other features like the location of the transaction and the spending patterns of the cardholder.
