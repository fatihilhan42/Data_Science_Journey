# Introduction to Data Science in Python
Welcome to the "Introduction to Data Science in Python" folder of the Data Science Journey repository! This folder contains a series of studies on getting started with data science using Python. The studies cover the following topics:

## Python basics
In this study, you will learn the fundamentals of the Python programming language. You will learn about:

- The basic syntax of Python, including variables, data types, and operators.
- Control structures, such as loops and conditional statements.
- Functions and modules, which allow you to organize and reuse your code.
- Exception handling, which allows you to handle errors and exceptions in your code.

## Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. In this study, you will learn how to use Pandas to:

- Load and import data from various sources, such as CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases.
- Clean and transform data using techniques such as filtering, aggregation, and pivoting.
- Analyze and visualize data using tools such as plots, charts, and statistical tests.

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a library for data visualization in Python. In this study, you will learn how to use Matplotlib to:

- Create various types of plots, including line plots, bar plots, and scatter plots.
- Customize plots by setting options such as labels, titles, and legends.
- Save plots to files or display them in a web browser.

## Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for creating advanced plots and charts in Python. In this study, you will learn how to use Seaborn to:

- Create more sophisticated plots, such as heatmaps, pair plots, and violin plots.
- Use Seaborn's built-in themes and styles to make your plots look professional.
- Combine multiple plots into a single figure using subplots.

Each study includes explanations and examples of how to use these libraries to perform common data science tasks. The studies are intended for beginners, but experienced data scientists may also find them useful as a reference.
