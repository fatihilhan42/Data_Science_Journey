# NLP with Deep Learning using TensorFlow

Natural Language Processing (NLP) with deep learning involves using neural networks to understand and process human language. In this example, we'll explore a simple NLP task using TensorFlow.

## Installation

Make sure you have TensorFlow and any additional NLP libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
# Add other libraries as needed, for example:
# pip install nltk
# pip install spacy
```

Example Code
Let's consider a basic sentiment analysis task using a dataset of movie reviews. We'll use a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for this example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Sample data
reviews = [
    "The movie was great!",
    "I didn't like the plot.",
    "Amazing performance by the actors.",
    "It was a bit slow-paced."
]

labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(reviews)
total_words = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1

# Convert text to sequences
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(reviews)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences)

# Build the RNN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(total_words, 16, input_length=len(padded_sequences[0])))
model.add(LSTM(100))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10)

```

This code tokenizes the input text, converts it to sequences, and uses an Embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer for sentiment analysis. Adjust the model architecture and parameters based on your specific NLP task.

Explanation
Tokenizer: Converts text to sequences of numbers.
Embedding: Represents each word with a vector.
LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory layer for sequence modeling.
Dense: Fully connected layer for the final prediction.
compile and fit: Compile and train the model, respectively.
