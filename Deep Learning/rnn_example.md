# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Example with TensorFlow

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed for sequence modeling. In this example, we'll build a basic RNN using TensorFlow for a time-series prediction task.

## Installation

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Example Code
Let's consider a simple time-series prediction problem using a sine wave:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a sine wave for demonstration
timesteps = np.arange(0, 100, 0.1)
sin_wave = np.sin(timesteps)

# Create sequences for training
sequence_length = 10
sequences = [sin_wave[i:i+sequence_length] for i in range(len(sin_wave)-sequence_length)]

# Convert data to numpy arrays
X = np.array(sequences[:-1])
y = np.array(sequences[1:])

# Reshape data for RNN input
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

# Build the RNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(20, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=16)

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.plot(timesteps[1:], sin_wave[1:], label='Actual')
plt.plot(timesteps[1:], predictions.flatten(), label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code uses a simple RNN to predict the next value in a sine wave based on a sequence of previous values.

Explanation
SimpleRNN: The RNN layer in the model.
Dense: The fully connected layer for prediction.
compile and fit: Compile and train the model, respectively.
Adjust the model architecture and parameters based on your specific sequence modeling task.
