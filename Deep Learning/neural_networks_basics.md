# Neural Networks Basics

Neural networks are a fundamental concept in deep learning. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, that work together to learn patterns and make predictions. In this example, we'll cover some basic concepts.

## Neurons and Layers

A neural network consists of layers, each containing neurons. The input layer receives the initial data, hidden layers process information, and the output layer produces the final result.

## Activation Functions

Neurons in a neural network use activation functions to introduce non-linearities. Common activation functions include:

- **Sigmoid:** Converts input to values between 0 and 1.
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Outputs the input if positive; otherwise, outputs zero.
- **TanH:** Similar to the sigmoid but produces values between -1 and 1.

## Feedforward Process

The feedforward process involves passing input through the layers of the neural network to produce an output. Each connection has a weight, and the neurons use activation functions.

Example code using Python and TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Print the model summary
model.summary()
```


## Backpropagation
Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights based on the error between predictions and actual values. Backpropagation is the process of updating weights backward through the network.

## Conclusion
This is a basic overview of neural networks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for diving deeper into the world of deep learning.
