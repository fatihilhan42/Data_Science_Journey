# TensorFlow Example: Building a Simple Neural Network

In this example, we'll use TensorFlow to create a basic neural network for a binary classification task. TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework that provides high-level APIs for building and training neural networks.

## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
## Example Code
Let's create a simple neural network for classifying data with two features:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate dummy data for demonstration
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
X_train = np.random.random((1000, 2))
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))

# Build the neural network
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=2, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```


This code creates a sequential model with one hidden layer containing 64 neurons, uses the ReLU activation function, and outputs binary predictions using the sigmoid activation function. The model is then compiled with binary crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

Explanation
Sequential: The sequential model allows us to create a linear stack of layers.
Dense: This layer represents a fully connected layer. The first Dense layer has 64 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function. The output layer has 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
compile: Configures the model for training with a specified loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
fit: Trains the model on the input data for a specified number of epochs and batch size.
Adjust the model architecture and parameters based on your specific use case and dataset.
