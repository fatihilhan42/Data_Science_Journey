# Transfer Learning with TensorFlow

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning where a model trained on one task is adapted for a different, but related, task. In this example, we'll use transfer learning with a pre-trained model in TensorFlow.

## Installation

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```


Example Code
Let's use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as MobileNetV2, for a new image classification task:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)

# Choose an image for prediction
img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

# Make predictions using the pre-trained model
predictions = base_model.predict(img_array)
decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]

# Display the top predictions
for i, (imagenet_id, label, score) in enumerate(decoded_predictions):
    print(f"{i + 1}: {label} ({score:.2f})")

# Fine-tune the model for a new task (replace this with your task-specific model)
# Add your custom dense layers on top of the pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')  # Replace 'num_classes' with your number of classes
])

# Compile and train the model on your new task-specific dataset

```

Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the path to the image you want to classify and adjust the architecture for your specific task.

Explanation
MobileNetV2: A pre-trained CNN model.
preprocess_input: Function for pre-processing images.
decode_predictions: Function to decode model predictions into human-readable labels.
Custom model: Extend the pre-trained model with your specific task's architecture.
