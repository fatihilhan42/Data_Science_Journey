# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Example with TensorFlow

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning. In this example, we'll create a basic GAN using TensorFlow to generate synthetic images.

## Installation

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Example Code
Let's create a simple GAN to generate images that resemble a Gaussian distribution:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Reshape, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Generator model
generator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, input_shape=(100,), activation='relu'),
    Dense(784, activation='sigmoid'),
    Reshape((28, 28, 1))
])

# Discriminator model
discriminator = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Combined GAN model
discriminator.trainable = False
gan = Sequential([generator, discriminator])

# Compile models
discriminator.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
gan.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Generate fake images using the generator
noise = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 100])
generated_image = generator.predict(noise)

# Train the GAN
# (Note: The actual training process involves a loop of updating the generator and discriminator)

```

In this example, the generator creates fake images, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The GAN is trained by optimizing the generator to generate more realistic images that fool the discriminator.

Explanation
Sequential: A linear stack of layers for building the generator, discriminator, and GAN models.
Dense: Fully connected layers in the generator and discriminator.
Reshape, Flatten: Reshape layers for transforming data between 1D and 2D.
compile: Configures the model for training with the specified optimizer and loss.
This example provides a simplified overview. In a real-world scenario, GANs involve a more complex training process and often use convolutional layers for image generation.
