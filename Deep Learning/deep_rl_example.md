# Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Example with TensorFlow

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a field of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. In this example, we'll create a basic DRL setup using TensorFlow to train an agent to play a simple game.

## Installation

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

Example Code
Let's consider a simple Q-learning example with a Deep Q Network (DQN) to train an agent to navigate a grid world:


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the Q-network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, input_shape=(4,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='linear')  # 2 actions in this example (left or right)
])

# Define the Q-learning algorithm
def q_learning(model, state, epsilon=0.1):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return np.random.randint(2)  # Explore by choosing a random action
    else:
        q_values = model.predict(state.reshape(1, -1))
        return np.argmax(q_values)  # Exploit by choosing the action with the highest Q-value

# Define the environment (grid world in this example)
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0])  # Example state representation
        self.done = False

    def step(self, action):
        # Simulate environment step and return new state and reward
        # Example: Move agent left (action=0) or right (action=1)
        if action == 0:
            self.state[0] -= 1
        else:
            self.state[0] += 1

        # Example: Provide reward for reaching a goal or punish for hitting a wall
        reward = 1 if self.state[0] == 10 else -1 if self.state[0] == -10 else 0
        self.done = abs(self.state[0]) == 10  # Terminate episode if the goal is reached or agent hits a wall

        return self.state, reward, self.done

# Training loop
env = Environment()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.state
    total_reward = 0

    while not env.done:
        action = q_learning(model, state)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)

        # Update the Q-value using the Bellman equation
        target = reward + 0.99 * np.max(model.predict(next_state.reshape(1, -1)))
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            q_values = model(state.reshape(1, -1))
            loss = tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(target, q_values[0][action])

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        state = next_state
        total_reward += reward

    print(f"Episode {episode + 1}, Total Reward: {total_reward}")

```

This example provides a simple illustration of Q-learning with a DQN. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use more complex environments and deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Explanation
Sequential: A linear stack of layers for building the Q-network.
Dense: Fully connected layers in the Q-network.
q_learning: Function to choose actions based on the epsilon-greedy strategy.
Environment: Simulated environment for the agent to interact with.
Training loop: Iteratively interacts with the environment, updates Q-values, and trains the Q-network.
