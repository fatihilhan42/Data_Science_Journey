# Deep Learning Basics

In this section, we'll delve into the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of deep learning.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Activation Functions

Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linearities to the model. Common activation functions include:

- **Sigmoid:** Useful in the output layer for binary classification.
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** Popular for hidden layers, introducing non-linearity.
- **Tanh:** Similar to the sigmoid but maps values to the range [-1, 1].

### 2. Backpropagation

Backpropagation is an optimization algorithm used to train neural networks. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and updating the weights to minimize the loss.

### 3. Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a key optimization technique in deep learning. It aims to find the minimum of the loss function by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.

## Practical Tips

To master the basics of deep learning, consider the following tips:

1. **Experiment with Activation Functions:** Understand how different activation functions impact model performance.
2. **Implement Backpropagation:** Code a simple neural network and implement backpropagation to see how weights are updated during training.
3. **Explore Gradient Descent Variants:** Learn about variations of gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and mini-batch gradient descent.

By grasping these fundamental concepts, you'll be well-prepared to tackle more advanced topics in deep learning.
