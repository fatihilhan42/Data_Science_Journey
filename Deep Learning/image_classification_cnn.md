# Image Classification with CNN using TensorFlow

In this example, we'll build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to perform image classification. CNNs are especially effective for tasks like image recognition due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns.

## Installation

Ensure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```


Example Code
Let's create a simple CNN for image classification using the popular MNIST dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)

# Build the CNN model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)
```

This code sets up a CNN with three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. It is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

Explanation
Conv2D: Convolutional layers to extract features from input images.
MaxPooling2D: Max-pooling layers to down-sample the spatial dimensions.
Flatten: Flattens the output for feeding into densely connected layers.
Dense: Fully connected layers for final classification.
compile and fit: Compile and train the model, respectively.
Adjust the model architecture and parameters based on your specific use case and dataset.
